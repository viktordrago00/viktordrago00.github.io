My Portfolio

This site is made to be a place where potential employers can learn more about me. This site lists a little bit about how I am as a worker. It showcases some projects that I have completed. It also says what I look for in a job and what I enjoy doing.

I coded this site with VS Code and used github to publish it. 

Designed by me, Viktor Medvinsky
